# AI Agent Orchestration

# Part 1 - AI Agent Orchestration Overview

---

# 1. Introduction

AI Agent Orchestration is the central coordination layer of AI-QA-OS.

It manages every AI agent participating in the system and ensures they work together efficiently.

Instead of allowing agents to operate independently, the Orchestrator controls:

- Agent Registration
- Agent Discovery
- Task Assignment
- Agent Communication
- Execution Monitoring
- Result Collection
- Failure Recovery

The objective is:

"Coordinate multiple AI agents into one intelligent autonomous QA system."
