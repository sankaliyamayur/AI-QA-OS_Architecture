# Workflow Engine Architecture


# Part 1 - Workflow Engine Overview & Architecture


---

# 1. Introduction

Workflow Engine is the execution orchestration layer of AI-QA-OS.

It converts AI decisions into executable task sequences.

The Workflow Engine controls:

- Task execution order
- Agent coordination
- Dependency handling
- Execution tracking
- Failure recovery

```

---

# 3. Workflow Planning Responsibilities


The planner decides:


```

What tasks are required?


Which agents are required?


What is execution order?


Which tasks can run parallel?


What dependencies exist?


```

---

# 4. Dynamic Workflow Generation


Workflow is created dynamically based on request.


Example:


Input:


```

Create API Testing Automation


```


Generated Workflow:


```

1. Analyze API Requirement

2. Generate API Test Cases

3. Create REST Assured Scripts

4. Execute API Tests

5. Generate Report


```

---

# 5. Workflow Definition Model


Each workflow contains:


```

Workflow ID

Description

Tasks

Dependencies

Agents

Execution Rules

Status


```

---

Example:


```json
{

"workflowId":"WF001",

"name":"Login Automation",

"tasks":[

"Requirement Analysis",

# Part 3 - Task Dependency Management


# 1. Introduction

Task Dependency Management controls relationships between workflow tasks.

It ensures tasks execute in the correct order based on their requirements.

---

# 2. Dependency Management Purpose


The system manages:


```

Task Order

Task Relationship

Execution Sequence

Blocking Conditions

Parallel Execution


```

---

# 3. Dependency Architecture


```

                      |

              Dependency Manager


                      |

        --------------------------------


        |              |              |


 Dependency     Scheduler      Validator

                      |

              Task Execution Engine


```

---

# 4. DAG Based Workflow Model


AI-QA-OS uses Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based execution.


Example:


```

Requirement Analysis


          |

          ↓


Test Case Generation


          |

          ↓


Automation Generation


          |

          ↓


Test Execution


          |

          ↓


Report Generation


```

---

# 5. Task Node Structure


Each task is represented as a node.


Example:


```json
{

"taskId":"TASK001",

"name":"Generate Test Cases",

"agent":"TestCaseAgent",

"status":"PENDING",

"dependency":[

"TASK000"

]

}

```

---

# 6. Dependency Types


## 6.1 Sequential Dependency


One task waits for another task.


Example:


```

Task A

 |

 ↓

Task B


```

---

## 6.2 Parallel Dependency


Multiple tasks execute together.


Example:


```

        Requirement


             |

   -------------------


   |                 |


 API Testing     UI Testing


```

---

## 6.3 Conditional Dependency


Execution depends on condition.


Example:


```

IF Test Failed


        ↓


Run Bug Analysis Agent


```

---

## 6.4 Approval Dependency


Requires human approval.


Example:


```

Generate Automation


        ↓


QA Approval


        ↓


Execute Tests


```

---

# 7. Dependency Resolver


Purpose:

Determine correct execution order.


Flow:


```

Load Tasks


↓

Read Dependencies


↓

↓

Send Tasks To Scheduler


```

---

# 8. Dependency Validation


Before execution:


System checks:


```

No Circular Dependency


All Required Tasks Available


Dependency Exists


Execution Order Valid


```

---

# 9. Circular Dependency Handling


Invalid Example:


```

Task A

 ↓

Task B

 ↓

Task A


```

System:


```

Detect Cycle


↓

Stop Workflow


↓

Generate Error


```

---

# 10. Task Scheduling Logic


Scheduler decides:


```

Which task starts?


Which task waits?


Which task runs parallel?


```

---

Example:


```

Task 1 Completed


        |

        ↓


Check Dependent Tasks


        |

        ↓


Start Available Tasks


```

---

# 11. Parallel Execution Management


Example:


Regression Workflow:


```

                Test Data Setup


                       |

        --------------------------------


        |              |              |


 UI Tests        API Tests       DB Tests


        |              |              |


        --------------------------------


                       |

                       |

              Final Validation


```

---

# 12. Dependency State Management


Each task maintains state:


```

WAITING


READY


RUNNING


COMPLETED


FAILED


BLOCKED


```

CANCELLED


```

---

# 5. Task States


Each task maintains:


```

```

---

# 6. Agent Execution States


Agent status:


```
